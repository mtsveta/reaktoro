Reactive transport modelling of a rock core after brine injection (manual)
==========================================================================

In this tutorial, we show how Reaktoro can be used for sequential calculations of the
reactive transport of a rock core after injecting the fluid and rock composition. Unlike
in the tutorial Reactive Transport with ReactiveTransportSolver, we provide here the detailed implementation of the
reactive transport (without exploitation of the predefined class ``ReactiveTransportSolver``).

We proceed with the step-by-step explanation of the script that can be found in a full length at
the very end.

Importing python packages
-------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 1
    :end-before: Step 2

Using Reaktoro in Python requires first an import of the python package
**reaktoro**. From this point on, we are able to use the library components of
Reaktoro (classes, methods, constants), which are needed to define our chemical
system and chemical reaction modeling problems.

.. note::

    To simplify the tutorials, we use ``from reaktoro import *``, which imports
    all components of the **reaktoro** package into the default Python
    namespace. We note that this can potentially create name conflicts when used
    in bigger projects. For your applications, consider using ``import reaktoro as rkt``
    instead, and call classes and methods as ``rkt.Database``, ``rkt.ChemicalSystem``,
    ``rkt.equilibrate``, and etc.

In addition to the **reaktoro** package, we need to import numpy package for working with arrays,
**matplotlib** for plotting capabilities, **joblib** package that enable the set of tools to provide
lightweight pipelining in Python (simple parallel computing), and, finally, **os** that provides a
portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

Initializing an auxiliary time-related constants
------------------------------------------------

In this step,

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 2
    :end-before: Step 3

we initialize an auxiliary time-related constants from seconds up to years.

Defining parameters for the reactive transport simulation
---------------------------------------------------------

Next, we define reactive transport and numerical discretization parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 3
    :end-before: Step 4

We specify the considered rock domain by setting the coordinate of its left boundary to
0.0 and right boundary to 100.0. The discretization parameters, i.e., both the number of cells and
steps in time, are set to 100. The reactive transport modeling procedure assumes a constant
fluid velocity of v = 1 m/day (1.16 · 10−5 m/s) and a constant diffusion coefficient D = 10−9 m2/s.
Parameter ``dirichlet`` is initialized by **True** or **False** depending on which boundary
conditions are considered in the numerical test. If it is set to **False**,  the natural flux conditions
are considered, and Dirichlet otherwise. The size of the time-step is set to be 10 minutes.
The temperature is set to 333.15 K (Kevin), whereas the pressure is fixed to 100 MPa (Megapascal).
The last parementer ``smrt_solv`` is initialized by **True** or **False** depending on which
equilibrium solver are used in the numerical test.

Defining the list of the output quantities
------------------------------------------

Before running the reactive transport simulations, we specify the list of parameters
we are interested in outputting. In this case, it is pH, molality of |H+|, |Ca++|, |Mg++|, |HCO3-|, |CO2(aq)|,
as well as phase volume of calcite and dolomite.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 4
    :end-before: Step 7

We provide the name of the file ``reativetransport.txt``, where the data should be collected.
We all have to specify the parameters that we are interested to output. In this case, it is
pH, molality of |H+|, |Ca++|, |Mg++|, |HCO3-|, |CO2(aq)|, as well as phase volume of calcite
and dolomite.

Defining the structure of the numerical experiment
--------------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 5

To provide the entry point of the python script, we use ``if __name__ == '__main__':``, which
"replaces" the call of ``main()`` function. The structure of the numerical experiment contains
three main blocks, i.e., creating the required folders for the results, running the simulations,
and plotting the obtained results.

Creating folders for the results' output
----------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 6
    :end-before: Step 5

Using **os** package, create requireв folders for outputting the obtained results.

Perform the reactive transport simulation
-----------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7
    :end-before: Step 10

We start from defining the chemical system using the ``ChemicalEditor`` class:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.1
    :end-before: Step 7.2

In particular, we specify **aqueous** and **mineral** phases that should be considered in the chemical system.
The aqueous phase is defined by manually specifying the chemical species (for the performance reasons).
The mineral phase contains three mineral species:
quartz |SiO2|, calcite |CaCO3|, and dolomite |CaMg(CO3)2|.

Creating the chemical system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.2
    :end-before: Step 7.3

This step is where we create an object of class ``ChemicalSystem`` using the
chemical system definition details stored in the object ``editor``.

Defining the initial condition (IC) of the reactive transport modeling problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After constructing the chemical system of interest, we can proceed to *defining the
chemical reaction problem*. First, we specify its **initial condition** with already
prescribed equilibrium conditions for *temperature*, *pressure*, and *amounts
of elements* that are consistent with an intention of modeling reactive transport
of injected |NaCl|-|MgCl2|-|CaCl2| brine into the rock-fluid composition of quartz
and calcite at 60 °C and 100 bar. In particular, we consider resident fluid is a 0.7
molal |NaCl| brine in equilibrium with the rock minerals with a calculated pH of 10.0.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.3
    :end-before: Step 7.4

.. note::
    Our **0.7 molal NaCl brine** is here represented by the mixture of
    1 kg of |H2O| and 0.7 mol of |NaCl|.

.. note::
    After providing the amounts of substances
    |H2O|, |NaCl|, quartz |SiO2|, and calcite |CaCO3| in the above code, Reaktoro parses
    these chemical formulas and determines the elements and their coefficients.
    Once this is done, the amount of each element stored inside the object
    ``problem_ic`` is incremented according to the given amount of substance and
    its coefficient in the formula. The amounts of elements you provide are
    then used as constraints for the Gibbs energy minimization calculation when
    computing the state of chemical equilibrium (i.e., when we try to find the
    amounts of all species in the system that corresponds to a state of minimum
    Gibbs energy and at the same time satisfying the *element amounts
    constraints*).

Defining the boundary condition (BC) of the reactive transport modeling problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, we define the **boundary condition** of the constructed chemical system with
its *temperature*, *pressure*, and *amounts of elements*.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.4
    :end-before: Step 7.5

In particular, we prescribe the amount of injected aqueous fluid resulting from
the mixture of
1 kg of water with
0.90 moles of |NaCl|,
0.05 moles of |MgCl2|,
0.01 moles of |CaCl2|, and
0.75 moles of |CO2|, in a state very close to |CO2| saturation.
The temperature and the pressure stay the same, i.e., 60 °C and 100 bar,
respectively.

Calculate the equilibrium states for the initial and boundary conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.5
    :end-before: Step 7.6

In this step, we use the ``equilibrate`` function to calculate the chemical
equilibrium state of the system with the given initial and boundary equilibrium
conditions stored in the object ``problem_ic`` and ``problem_bc``.
For this calculation, Reaktoro uses an efficient
**Gibbs energy minimization** computation to determine the species amounts that
correspond to a state of minimum Gibbs energy in the system, while satisfying
the prescribed amount conditions for temperature, pressure, and element
amounts. The result is stored in the objects ``state_ic`` and ``state_bc`` of
class ``ChemicalState``.

.. attention::

    In the vast majority of cases, there is one object of class ``ChemicalSystem``
    in the code and one or more objects of class ``ChemicalState`` describing different
    states of the chemical system. Reaktoro differentiates these two independent concepts:
    *chemical system definition* and *chemical system state*.


Scaling the phases in the IC as required and BC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, we scale the phases in the initial condition according to the following composition, i.e.,
98|%vol| |SiO2| (quartz) and 2|%vol| |CaCO3| (calcite) with the porosity of 10%. Moreover,
the boundary condition state is scaled to 1 m3.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.6
    :end-before: Step 7.7



Specifying discretization structures needed for the reactive transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the next block of code, we provide some structures needed for the discretization of
the problem and reactive transport simulation.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.7
    :end-before: Step 7.8

We start by fetching the indices of the fluid and solid species to the ``ifluid_species``
and ``isolid_species`` lists, respectively. Then, we defined the numpy arrays ``b``,
``bprev``, ``bfluid``, ``bsolid``, that will store concentrations of each element
in each mesh cell for the whole system at the current and previous time step as well as
its fluid and solid partitions.

The arrays corresponding to the current step of the reactive transport is initialized by
concentrations of the elements at the initial chemical state using ``state_ic.elementAmounts()``.
The array ``b_bc`` will store the concentrations of each element on the boundary.
List ``states`` (of the size ``ncells``) contains chemical states for each cell.

Next, we generate the set of degrees of freedom (DOFs) discretizing the domain represented
by the interval *[xr, xl]* (can be regarded as a mesh). The corresponding spacial mesh size
is defined by ``dx``.


Creating the equilibrium solver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the repeated equilibrium calculation, we define an equilibrium solver object using
either ``EquilibriumSolver`` or ``SmartEquilibriumSolver`` classes, which are initialized
by a considered chemical system. Here, if parameter ``smrt_solv`` is set to **False**, the
classical approach performed by the class ``EquilibriumSolver`` is considered, and otherwise
the class ``SmartEquilibriumSolver`` is used.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.8
    :end-before: Step 7.9

In reactive transport simulations, we have to perform many equilibrium calculations in sequence.
The usage of ``EquilibriumSolver`` becomes more practical because  each call of ``equilibrate``
method has a computational overhead from creating a new object of class ``EquilibriumSolver``.
Therefore, we create this object only once and then used subsequently for all other equilibrium
calculations.

Define auxiliary function for creating the output file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The auxiliary routine ``outputstate`` is a function that uses the class ``ChemicalOutput``
to output requested by the user information into the output file.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.9
    :end-before: Step 7.10

Running the reactive transport simulation loop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before proceeding to the simulation of reactive transport on the considered interval,
we set the initial time and a counter for the step considered in this cycle. Besides,
in ``ndigits`` we store the number of digits in the selected amount of steps
(for the reactive transport)

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.10
    :end-before: Step 7.11

The cycle for the reactive transport simulation proceeds until we haven't made all the steps
in time. At each time step, we output the progress of the simulations by auxiliary routine
``outputstate()``.

Then, we collect the amounts of elements from fluid and solid partition. This is done according
to the **operator splitting procedure**. First, we update the amounts of elements the fluid partition
using transport equation.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.10.1
    :end-before: Step 6

The transport is performed by the ``transport()`` routine that excepts the amounts *j*-th element,
current time and space discretization step, parameters of the reactive transport velocity and
diffusion coefficient, and amounts of *j*-th element on the boundary. The routine has the following
structure. It defines the discretization constants ``alpha`` and ``beta`` that correspond
to the diffusion and advection terms in the equation, i.e., ``D*dt/dx**2`` and ``v*dt/dx``,
respectively. Arrays ``a``, ``b``, ``c`` follow from the the finite difference discretization of
of the reaction-advection equation (TODO: specify, which finite differences are used). Finally,
the obtained system of equation is solved by the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, also known as the
Thomas algorithm.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 7.10.2
    :end-before: Step 7.10.1

The second step of **operator splitting procedure** is to update the total amounts of elements
by accounting the earlier reconstructed fluid partition and solid partition (that stays constant
with respect to time).

At last, we perform equilibrating for all the cells with the updated element amounts. Obtained
amount are stored in the ``bprev`` in order to (TODO: for what ?).

Plotting of the results
-----------------------

The last block of the main routine is plotting of the results.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../demos/python/demo-reactive-transport-calcite-dolomite.py
    :start-at: Step 8
    :end-before: Step Step 7.10.2


The above step-by-step explanation is summarized in a script.
